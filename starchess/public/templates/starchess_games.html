      <p>StarChess is a chess variant on a star-shaped board, and very easy to pick up if you know chess. <b>Original rules <a href="http://www.polgarstarchess.com/Rules/ENRules.html">here</a>.</b>
      <br/> Note that I've changed the rules slightly - rooks can now move 1 non-taking square diagonally as well as their normal up and down.
      <br/> Advanced choose mode allows you to each choose the home row piece placement before game start.

      <p>Starcraft Chess is way different than chess, and has more of a resource creation / RTS feel. <b>Original rules <a href="https://unorthodox-engineers.blogspot.com/2014/02/starchess-rules.html">here</a>.</b>
